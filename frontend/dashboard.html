    <h2>Welcome to Block NEX</h2>
    <p class="student-note">Working on Block NEX as our final-year project has been a genuinely rewarding experience. As a team we learned to listen, adapt, and solve real problems together — from late-night debugging to celebrating small wins. Building something that other people can use taught us responsibility and the importance of clear communication, thoughtful UX, and respect for user privacy. We're proud of what we made and excited to carry these lessons into our careers.</p>
